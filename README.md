# Chuck Norris Jokes App

## Overview

This project is a simple web application that fetches random Chuck Norris jokes using the Chuck Norris Jokes API. It demonstrates the use of `XMLHttpRequest` to make API calls and display data dynamically on a web page. The app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Though using `fetch` is the modern approach, the course I took encouraged us to learn about the XMLHttpRequest in case we come across it in older code.

## Features

- Fetches a random joke from the Chuck Norris Jokes API.
- Displays the joke on the webpage.
- Allows users to fetch a new joke by clicking a button.

## Technologies Used
